This was a small project I did on my free time.

This Consist in a calculator to work in paralell procesorss/machines to calculate heavy calculations.


How to (localhost mode):

1)
- Open AdvEuler.exe
- In AdvEuler Go to "Rendimiento" at menu and select "N*X PC's..."
- In the new window form created ("Cerebro") Click at "Crear Cerebro"

2)
- Now on the explorer go to the project\neurona\ and open Neurona.exe
- At textbox "Neurona:" specify a neurona name and click on button "Activar Neurona"
- Don't close this window.

3)
- Now on AdvEuler at Cerebro Form, you can see the "Neurona" connected listed.
- Now you can click at "Activar Cerebro" to calculate euler number, with the client "Neurona"

Note: repeating step 2, the server will accumulate more neurons. if the neurons(client) are in a different machine, you should specify the ip of server.
